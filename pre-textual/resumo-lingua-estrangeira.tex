\begin{otherlanguage*}{english}

The growing application of automation technologies in residential environments has driven the development of systems aimed at optimizing everyday tasks. In this context, this work proposes the development of an automated system for the cleaning and maintenance of residential swimming pools, based on home automation principles and the Internet of Things (IoT).

The system integrates sensors, actuators, and microprocessed controllers to perform automated water monitoring and treatment, reducing the need for manual intervention.

The proposal seeks to improve resource efficiency, ensure safety in handling chemical products, and promote sustainability in water and energy consumption. The research included the review of technical standards, the study of mechanical and electronic components, and the development of a functional prototype.

The results demonstrated that automating the cleaning and treatment process of swimming pools is feasible and can minimize human errors, optimize maintenance time, and ensure appropriate water quality standards. Therefore, the developed system presents itself as a practical and accessible solution aligned with current trends in domotics and smart automation.
