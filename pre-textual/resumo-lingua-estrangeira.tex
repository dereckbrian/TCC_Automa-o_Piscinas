The increasing integration of automation technologies in residential settings has driven the development of systems designed to streamline daily tasks. In this context, this paper presents the development of an automated cleaning and maintenance system for residential swimming pools, grounded in the principles of home automation and the Internet of Things (IoT). The system integrates sensors, actuators, and microprocessor-based controllers to automatically monitor and treat water, significantly reducing the need for manual intervention. This proposal aims to enhance resource efficiency, improve safety during chemical handling, and promote sustainable water and energy consumption practices. The methodology involved reviewing technical standards, analyzing the mechanical and electronic components, and developing and validating a functional prototype. Results indicate that automating pool cleaning and treatment processes is technically feasible; it mitigates human error, optimizes maintenance time, and ensures appropriate water quality standards. It is concluded that the developed system represents a practical, accessible solution aligned with contemporary trends in smart home automation.
